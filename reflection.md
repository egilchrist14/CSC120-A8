Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a wasp in some sort of natural environment where the classes represent the ways it is able to interact with that environment.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
None
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It took a while to figure out how I wanted undo() to work within the context of my class representing a wasp and with the other methods, but since there was so much freedom with this assignment the advice I'd give is just to be creative with it since there are basically no restrictions and not be afraid to experiment to see what works.
